    "They perform a systematic search for Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars in the *Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution*\n",
    "(TGAS) catalog that formed part of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1), and identify 5 members of *NGC 104* (47 Tucanae), 1 member of *NGC 5272* (M 3), 5 members of *NGC 6121* (M 4), 7 members of *NGC 6397*, and 2 members of *NGC 6656* (M 22). \n",
    "\n",
    "By taking a weighted average of the member stars, fully **accounting for the correlations between parameter estimates**, **they estimate the parallax (and, hence, distance) and proper motion (PM) of the GCs**. This provides a homogeneous PM study of multiple GCs based on an astrometric catalogue with small and well-controlled systematic errors, and yields random PM errors that are similar to existing measurements. Detailed comparison to the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements generally shows excellent agreement, validating the astrometric quality of both TGAS and HST. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, comparison to ground-based measurements shows that some of those must have systematic errors exceeding the random errors. Our parallax estimates have uncertainties an order of magnitude larger than previous studies, but nevertheless imply distances consistent with previous estimates. By combining our PM measurements with literature positions, distances and radial velocities, we measure Galactocentric space motions for the clusters and find that these are also in good agreement with previous orbital analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our results highlight the future promise of Gaia for the determining accurate distances and PMs of Galactic GCs, which will provide crucial constraints on the near end of the cosmic distance ladder, and provide accurate GC orbital histories.\n",

    "**method**\n",
    "For each cluster, they calculate the likelihood of each nearby stars of being a cluster member by decomposing this likelihood into a positional part $L_{\\alpha\\delta,i}$ and a motion part $L_{\\varpi\\mu,i}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, stars close to the cluster centre of the cluster are more likely to be members than stars near to the $2\\,R_{tidal}$ boundary, so we also calculate the likelihood of a star $i$ with coordinates $(\\alpha_i, \\delta_i)$ being a member of the GC with centre $(\\alpha_{GC}, \\delta_{GC})$ as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "L_{\\alpha\\delta,i} &=& p(\\alpha_i, \\delta_i | \\alpha_{GC}, \\delta_{GC}, \\sigma)\n",

    "\n",
    "where they use $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2} R_{tidal}$ to account for the approximate extent of the cluster. **The uncertainties on the cluster centre coordinates and on the positions of the stars are negligible compared to the extent of the cluster, so we neglect the measurement errors in this calculation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, for a star $i$ with parallax  and PM measurements $m_i = (\\varpi, \\mu_\\alpha, \\mu_\\delta)$, and covariance $C_i$, they ask what is the likelihood $L_{\\varpi\\mu,i}$ that this star is a member of a GC with measurements $m_{GC}$ and covariance $C_{GC}$,\n",

    "The above is a standard 3-dimensional Gaussian. \n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the GC covariance matrix $C_{GC}$, they assume that the errors are uncorrelated, so the diagonal terms are the squared uncertainties on the parallax and PM measurements and the off-diagonal elements are zero. \n",
